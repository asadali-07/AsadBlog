Welcome to this comprehensive Python programming tutorial! Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to deepen your understanding of Python, this guide will take you through the fundamentals and introduce advanced concepts as you progress.

## Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. It is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation.

### Why Learn Python?

- **Easy to Learn**: Python has a simple syntax similar to English, making it beginner-friendly.
- **Versatile**: Used in web development, machine learning, automation, and more.
- **Strong Community**: Python has extensive libraries and a large support community.

## Setting Up Python

To get started with Python programming, you'll need to set up a development environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Choose an IDE/Text Editor**: Popular options include PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Verify Installation**: Run `python --version` in the terminal or command prompt.

## Python Basics

Now that your environment is set up, let’s start with the basics:

- **Variables and Data Types**
- **Control Structures**
- **Functions**
- **Loops and Iterations**
- **Exception Handling**

### Variables and Data Types

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.7
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Height: {height}")
```

### Control Structures

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

for i in range(5):
    print(f"Count: {i}")
```

### Functions

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

### Loops and Iterations

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Iteration {i}")
```

### Exception Handling

```python
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(f"You entered: {number}")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter a number.")
```

## Intermediate Python

- **Lists and Dictionaries**
- **File I/O**
- **Classes and Objects**
- **List Comprehensions**
- **Lambda Functions**

### Lists and Dictionaries

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
user = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(numbers, user["name"])
```

### File I/O

```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, File!")
```

### Classes and Objects

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

s1 = Student("Alice", 20)
print(s1.name, s1.age)
```

### List Comprehensions

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)
```

### Lambda Functions

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(5, 3))
```

## Advanced Python

- **Decorators**
- **Generators**
- **Multithreading**
- **Asynchronous Programming**

### Decorators

```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function call")
        func()
        print("After function call")
    return wrapper

@decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

### Generators

```python
def count_up(limit):
    for i in range(limit):
        yield i

for num in count_up(5):
    print(num)
```

### Multithreading

```python
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

### Asynchronous Programming

```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    print("Hello")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Goodbye")

asyncio.run(say_hello())
```
